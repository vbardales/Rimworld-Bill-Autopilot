# Bill Autopilot — status

Status sheet, read by a pass over every mod rather than by asking each session in turn.
It lives at the root, never in `Mod/`, so Steam never receives it.

The fields derived from disk on 2026-09-12 were checked one by one and hold. The four the sweep
cannot fill are settled here.

- **`stage`** — `preTest`, confirmed. Nothing has ever been published: no Workshop item, and
  `CHANGELOG.md` still marks 1.0.0 unreleased. The code and the showcase are finished, which is
  what separates this from `port` or `showcase`; what it waits on is a test pass, which is what
  separates it from `tested`.
- **`dependencies`** — `declared`, but only after checking, because the About lists **six**
  non-vanilla `loadAfter` entries that are not in `modDependencies`: Better Workbench Management,
  Nice Bill Tab, its Expansion, Choose Your Recipe, Dubs Mint Menus and Everybody Gets One. None
  of them is a dependency. Every one is reached by reflection, the only assemblies referenced at
  build time are the game's and Harmony's, and each accessor returns a neutral value when its mod
  is absent. `loadAfter` is there because we hook onto them when they happen to be present, and
  scenario 17 of `TESTING.md` exists to prove the mod runs with all six gone. An undeclared
  dependency is not cosmetic — on 2026-09-11 Reequilibrage animaux took 47 vanilla animals down
  with it, Muffalo included, because the class it injects belongs to a mod that was not declared
  and not loaded — which is why this one is written out rather than waved through.
- **`tested_on`** — 2026-09-01, when the base loop was confirmed by hand in a real save: bills put
  up and taken down on their own, a recipe unlocked by research arriving suspended, and deleting an
  automatic bill excluding its recipe. The line the sweep puts there by default, "never seen
  running", was wrong. But read the date against the seven lines above it: the build that ran that
  day is not this one, and everything written since has only ever been compiled.
- **`remaining`** — seven scenarios of `TESTING.md` that have never run. No known defect left
  unfixed and no feature missing from the first pass: what remains is unverified, not broken. The
  compatibility bridges come high because they fail silently by construction — a lost feature, never
  a crash — so nothing but a run will tell.

`TESTING.md` stays the source: it says for each scenario what it proves and what its failure looks
like. This sheet keeps only the balance.

One layer no longer waits on a run at all. `Tests/` holds a program that exercises the shipped
assembly against the real game assemblies with no game running, 44 checks over the decision layer,
non-zero exit on failure. It does not shorten the list above, because what it proves is arithmetic
and what the list wants is wiring.

`licence` vocabulary: `open` an explicit licence, `silent` no licence and a dead source,
`alive` no licence but a living source, `forbidden` a written refusal, `original` owing nothing
to anyone — not a name, not an idea traceable to one mod, not a value derived from its assets.
